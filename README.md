##What?
This is an experiment. For my final English project this year, I was asked to do *something* and my English teacher nudged me towards a synthesis of writing and coding.
In the end, I settled on this. My central thesis is--to not elaborately so specifically as to ruin the experience--a question as to the nature of belief and expectations.
My goal for the project is to take two entirely different mediums--a written essay with many words and a programmed game with none--and convey through them the same central
point, or, at least, force observers to consider the same essential question. I hope that says enough without saying too much. I'll also apologize in advance for the code
and promise that the essay is more well written than the game. Confined to a week of programming, I cut corners and chose quick coding over efficiency or elegance and I know
it shows through. It isn't perfect but, I hope when all is said and done, it does what it needs to do. Let me know what you think.
