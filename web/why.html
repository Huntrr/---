<p><span class="italics">Why did Sally fall off the swing?</span></p>
<p><span class="italics">Because she had no arms.</span></p>
<br>

<p>Expectations. </p>
<p>Sometimes they’re helpful. Sometimes they help you avoid orange juice after brushing your teeth; sometimes they keep you from plowing over a speed plateau and from making bad decisions. Other times, however, expectations fall a bit short. Like a joke turned sour. One path expected, another one taken. Like if Robert Frost took the road more traveled by. Or if Sally falls of the swing less because she slipped over a banana peel and more because she, well, has no arms.</p>
<p>And yet no number of failed expectations keep us from making expectations that are doomed to fail. Because, in a way, expectations act as an extension of some essential human faith. It’s the faith that the world is going to work always as it has in the past. That natural laws stay natural laws and things don’t just change circumstance to circumstance. </p>
<p>It’s wrong, of course. But we still cling to it. For the better. And for the worse.</p>
<p>As always, the bad news first.</p>
<p>False expectations can do a lot of harm. Namely in inhibitions and overexpectations. Inhibitions best exemplified by something like August Wilson’s <span class="italics">Fences</span>. Troy Maxson learns, through experience, that there’s a color barrier in sports. Troy took a leap and fell just short of the MLB; then he fell further and ended up a garbageman. As such, when his son grows up and wants to skip work for football so that he can go to college on a football scholarship and end up playing professional football, Troy puts his foot down. No football, he explains, because “the white man ain’t gonna let you get nowhere with that football noway" (Wilson 35). It won’t get you anywhere. Because it didn’t get <span class="italics">me</span> anywhere. </p>
<p>Expectations are the faith that history will repeat itself. And the inhibition comes from not wanting to make the same mistake twice. Forgoing the changes to the times and the relaxing of color barriers, Troy Maxson refuses his son’s aspirations because he expects it won’t work out. It’s a literary allusion to what’s never worked in history. It’s the warping of perspectives such that, when you say history will repeat itself, you mean you expect that some simple circumstance might follow as it had once the chance to in the past. </p>
<p>And that, if anything, is the seed of overexpectation. Like Jay Gatsby hoping he could get what James Gatz almost got.  As a younger man he’d won over Daisy. But then he left. And then she grew away. And fell into Tom Buchanan’s arms, and became Daisy Buchanan. And so, when Gatz-turned-Gatsby came to the Egg in hot pursuit of an old love, he took it on faith that things would work as they had before. That things’d work out okay. That he’d get his girl. </p>
<p>Of course he didn’t. No, he “believed in the green light" (Fitzgerald 180) that he couldn’t reach and, a “[boat] against the current" (Fitzgerald 180), Gatsby found himself “borne back ceaselessly into the past" (Fitzgerald 180) of his own accord. His desire for the past was the current that borne him from the future; his expectations of historical repetition were, to say without any drama, entirely misguided.</p>
<p>Overexpectations. It’s why the entire Western world appeased Hitler at all the wrong moments because they’d seen World War I and expected they could avoid her sequel through an aversion from the same causes. <span style="italics">History repeats itself</span>, they say, and yet somehow there’s no time <span style="italics">like</span> the present. Make sense of that.</p>
<p>I know for a fact that history doesn’t repeat itself. And it didn’t take drowning between East and West Egg or engaging in a second iteration of The Great War for me to figure it out. No, I was three when my expectations began to fall apart. At ages one, zero, and two I’d wake up in Florida—where we lived at the time—to the warm winter-time discovery that my parents had conspired with our neighbors and ordered a delivery of snow—or at least a mixture of crushed up ice—to our Cul De Sac. I’d get all giddy like a two-year-old seeing a cluster of crushed up particles of frozen water and run downstairs in my T-shirt and shorts to go and play in the ‘snow.’ </p>
<p>The first year we moved to Connecticut, I woke up one morning to the biggest delivery of crushed up ice I’d ever seen. We no longer lived in a Cul De Sac, yet somehow now the entire street was covered in snow. So, as had become tradition, I ran up to my room and sprang into my snow gear—a T-shirt and shorts as always—and tumbled down the stairs to my mom in pursuit of my petition to go play in the snow. No, she said, I couldn’t go outside like that. I needed, apparently, a jacket and something called snow pants.</p>
<p>Of course I cried and temper-tantrumed, utterly distraught at the ruthless oppression brought forth upon me. My face went red and tears streamed down my face until, finally, my dad whimpered out the fateful words: Oh just let him go outside, he’ll learn it for himself soon enough. </p>
<p>Needless to say, our neighbor called shortly after to ask if some poor animal was dying in our yard, as the screaming was indeed that dreadful, and I quickly learned that winter in Connecticut is colder than winter in Florida and that my expectations of snow did not match a different manifestation of snow. No; life was more complicated than that. </p>
<p>But, still, the faith that things will work as they had in the past—misguided as it may be—is an entirely reasonable faith. Troy has definite cause to think his son won’t make it playing football and Gatsby has definite cause to think he’ll win back Daisy and the Allies had cause to think Hitler really only wanted a little bit of the Sudetenland, but, I suppose, only in the same way <span class="italics">I</span> had cause to think that snow wouldn’t be cold. So, I also suppose, perhaps it wasn’t really that reasonable of a faith.</p>
<p>Rational, maybe. We can chalk it up to at least that. At least it’s more rational than other kinds of expectations. Because, just as people sometimes have this unreasonable faith that things will always turn out as they had before—even given differing circumstances and hidden variables—they’ll also sometimes put all their faith in things working out the way they <span class="italics">should</span>. And while there is some amount of reason to betting it all on California Chrome because he’s been “hot" the past few races, there’s never really any reason to making a straight up one-number bet in roulette. That’s the kind of expectations that are just plain <span class="italics">ir</span>rational.</p>
<p>Indeed, it’s the kind of expectation reminiscent of Frederick Henry’s <span class="italics">Farewell to Arms</span> belief that bad things just would pass faster than good things. That, in the end, he’d escaped the hardships of a life surrounded by death and that, in the end, he’d have his Catherine Barkley and his happily ever after. Early on in the novel, he “knew [he] would not be killed. Not in this war" (Hemingway 37). This lies with stark contrast against his later statement—in the maternity ward at Catherine’s death bed—that “I knew she was going to die and I prayed that she would not" (Hemingway 330). Expectations of his life against expectations of her death. In the beginning, all the way up to the end of Catherine’s pregnancy, the expectation is that his involvement in the war that he hates will pass faster than everything that he loves. This is, of course, the expectation of every soldier sent to war. Not for any good reason—clearly happiness can and does end on occasion faster than war—but because of the blind faith that things will work out as they should.</p>
<p>It’s a belief in destiny turned in your favor. Like Willy Loman in <span class="italics">Death of a Salesman</span>, so certain that his kids would be destined for something great. Why? Because “I am not a dime a dozen! I am Willy Loman" (Miller 105) and you’re not a dime a dozen, because “you are Biff Loman" (Miller 105)! No rationale. Just the desire to not be commonplace. Natural desire, <span class="italics">maybe</span>, but irrational all the same. It’s the belief that things will end up in your favor because its ‘destined’ to work like that. As if the universe is slanted in one direction instead of the other, and you are so familiar with its inner machinations that you know exactly how the clock is going to tick. </p>
<p>You don’t.</p>
<p>You shouldn’t need <span class="italics">The Stranger</span> to tell you that there’s a certain “gentle indifference of the world" (Camus 122). To need such teachings is to be one of Job’s misguided companions and feel that the just and righteous are only punished because they aren’t just and righteous and that “if thou wert pure and upright; surely now [God] would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous" (Job 8:6). Not quite. Karma isn’t real. The universe doesn’t tilt in the direction of the just. It most certainly doesn’t tilt in <span class="italics">your</span> direction—not if that’s what you’ve come to expect. Ignore any expectations of greater purpose and divinity, because even those that might be there are incomprehensible. The universe, for all intents and effective purposes, is as Camus puts it: indifferent.</p>
<p>To expect otherwise is to believe in a certain kind of magic that, if ever present, has long since disappeared. Surely, then, assumptions do as the saying goes, and the universe just doesn’t work like that. We live on a pale blue dot suspended in the vastness of a space more grand than our minds can comprehend. Black holes and distant stars and alien galaxies all—by simple derivation of mass—have more gravity than any single human being to ever have existed, and thus have more pull on the direction of the universe than any one of us.</p>
<br>
<p class="italics">Knock knock.</p>
<p class="italics">Who’s there?</p>
<p class="italics">Definitely not Sally.</p>
<p class="italics small">... She has no arms.</p>
<br>
<p>Fuck. Even when you <span class="italics">expect</span> the unexpected, it still manages to creep up on you. But, maybe it’s not all drear. Maybe there is good news to complement the bad, and maybe there’s a place where expectations and improperly placed faith seem to work. Take these jokes. Morbid. Absolutely terrible. I wouldn’t even consider them jokes. But I <span class="italics">would</span> consider them humorous. Sure. Humor. Humor’s good. And really all jokes are based in the unexpected. </p>
<br>
<p class="italics">Why’d the man cross the road?</p>
<p class="italics">Because he was heading to the</p>
<p class="italics">bakery to pick up a loaf of bread.</p>
</br>
<p>That’s not funny. Even jokes you’ve heard before aren’t funny because you know what to expect. Humor derives itself from the very same concept—unexpectedness—that drives most of our deepest misfortunes and regrets.</p>
<p>Jeez. That took a dark turn rather quickly, didn’t it?</p>
<p>But it doesn’t have to. Expectations can cause all kinds of good. Just as Eliphaz’s and Bildad’s and Zophar’s expectations of fate—that bad things happen to bad people and google things to good people—mislead them into a pattern of speech God later mocks as “[darkening] counsel by words without knowledge" (Job 38:2), Elihu and Job stick to their expectations of a world in which natural occurrences can sometimes be inexplicable (offering a religious twist to that <span class="italics">The Stranger</span> style of thought wherein, for all meaningful purposes, the universe ought be regarded as indifferent, since things will always happen to defy all unreasonable expectation) and that allows them a perspective of casual understanding. They might not like it—Job certainly shouldn’t—but they know better than to assume there’s another way things ought to be. And perhaps, in some peculiar way, it offers them a more true version of the universe.</p>
<p>It’s a version of the universe in which they know less—understand less—but that which they do know is more certain than that which is “known" by Eliphaz and Bildad and Zophar. In a way, it’s a different kind of expectation—the expectation of not getting special treatment on the part of the universe—that leads them to a less clear, more certain path. It helps them know less and be right more. And so, just maybe, there’s a nonhumorous , nonsimple application of expectation. </p>
<p>Reasonable expectation can be useful.</p>
<p>But, wait, there’s more. Because maybe even <span class="italics">Death of a Salesman</span>, from a bit of a different angle, offered an application of unreasonable expectation. Certainly, Willy Loman has an unreasonable faith in the workings of the universe. His expectation of familial grandeur—the faith that things will work out for him—is just as misled as the expectations of Eliphaz and Zophar. So it’s directly opposite those more apparently reasonable expectations of Job. And, of course, there’s a negative aspect—namely that he’s blatantly wrong—to that misheld and wronged sense of expectation.</p>
<p>But maybe it’s not all that bad.</p>
<p>Hear this one out. Willy Loman’s insatiable belief that the Loman family is destined to be big gives him something to cling to. Moreover, it’s something to cling to at a point in his life when he has very little to cling to. He’s started growing old and he’s lost his job and his kids don’t quite seem to be going anywhere in life. As his friend Charley puts it, a salesman’s gotta “[ride] on a smile and a shoeshine" (Miller 111) and Willy’s gotten himself to a point where “they start not smiling back" (Miller 111). The hope—nay the blind faith—that neither he nor his kids are a ‘dime a dozen’ gives his life a bit more meaning. Heck, it gives his death meaning to him once he begins to presume that his life insurance money can be used to kickstart his kids’ business careers. It gave a depressed man something to smile about.</p>
<p>So maybe expectations—even the irrational ones—aren’t all that bad. Sure, this unreasonable expectation cumulated in Willy Loman’s death, but it also gave him a bit more of a push while he was alive. So, then, there’s something else. And the most immediate term that comes to mind is hope.</p>
<p>Hope.</p>
<p>The beautiful colors as light refracts through falling droplets of soap, even though the bubble they came from just burst. The way sand seems to flow wonderfully like time in the wind even as it’s slipping through your fingers. Hope’s what’s left to hold onto after everything else starts to end up all busted. All wrong. A bit of right in the wrong. Maybe that’s what unreasonable expectations really are. A bit of right hidden in the wrong.</p>
<p>In Ann Patchett’s <span class="italics">Bel Canto</span>, it’s the hope of love and beauty from the confines of a hostage situation in a foreign country. Katsumi Hosokawa’s fantasies of having “given up everything for [Roxane Coss]" (Patchett 291)—his business, family, and home—having given up it all for the beautiful woman with the beautiful voice. His translator Gen’s fantasies of running off with one of the terrorists, a girl—Carmen—and her fantasies of running off with him. The entirely unreasonable expectation that the hostage situation will end in fires of passion instead of flames of pain. The entirely unreasonable expectation of Jay Gatsby and Willy Loman and three-year-old-me-playing-in-the-snow that things can and will and do work out like you want them to. Even thought, in reality, the world is indifferent and that, at the very end, even the universe is going to have to stop spinning. </p>
<p>A little bit of right in the sea of wrong.</p>
<p>Hope is just improper expectation.</p>
<p>Is that so wrong?</p>
<p>No. So, in that case, what distinguishes the ‘right’ expectations from the ‘wrong’ ones? Because, in both cases, expectations—faith or belief—can be wrong. Or untruthful? At the very least: a little bit blind. What makes the inherently wrong so helpfully right? If so much good is based on truth, how can anything good ever come from being willfully wrong, and how can we figure which expectations are worth holding onto, and which do we need to just let go of?</p>
<p>Perhaps, just maybe, there’s some integral characteristic that separates Katsumi Hosokawa from Jay Gatsby. That separates healthy hope from unhealthy desires. Good expectations from bad. But what? Any comparison I make can be countered upon. If I say it comes from the resultant hope—and assert therefore that hope is inherently good—all you need to say is that Gatsby had <span class="italics">hope</span>. Hope he’d get the girl, just like Mr. Hosokawa’s hope for Roxane Coss. And if I say that, as was the case with Job, good expectations come from sticking to the purest of gut feelings, then all you need to do is compare his love for God with Willy Loman’s twisted love for family. If I point to the morbid jokes and say that it comes down to the irony of one path expected and another taken, then all you need to do it point at <span class="italics">A Farewell to Arms</span> and remind me that the death of a mother in the room where she gave birth to her child is nature’s morbidest joke, her cruelest irony.</p>
<p>The only pattern is in the outcome. Good versus bad. Even then, there’s a certain level of subjectivity to it; Willy’s outcome—death—is inherently bad but his expectations also gave a hopeless man a little bit of hope, and I wouldn’t argue if you sought to find some good in that. You’d expect from this a meaningful conclusion, but what kind is there to offer?</p>
<p>There’s an unexpected duality to even the most improper of expectations. Willy’s expectations are good and bad. Even Katsumi’s—the kind that bring hope—also serve to blind him from the harsh reality of the world he lives in. Blindness isn’t good, yet the blindness there is a means to a good end. In most cases, it’s bad to be wrong. Yet wrong expectations can make a bitter life palatable, and there isn’t too much wrong with that.</p>
<p>The duality reminds, distantly, of an old story about King Solomon. In that characteristically philosophical mood, he ordered a servant to find him an item that could make a happy man sad and a sad man happy. And as such the man went out into the world and began to search far and wide, his efforts mostly fruitless until, at last, he found a man who claimed to have what he needed. The man offered him a ring which, after taking a single look at its inscription, Solomon’s servant knew was exactly what he needed. Having been hopeless and sad up until that point, he finally smiled. He brought the ring back to Solomon who, having been in a spirit of happiness then and there, was suddenly overtaken by sadness. The inscription? It was simple.</p>
<p>“This too shall pass."</p>
<p>Good things pass. Bad things pass. Good things can be bad. Bad things good. Expectations don’t work as you’d expect. The world is always turning—the universe always changing—</p>
<p>—maybe the solution has been there the entire time. There <span class="italics">is</span> goodness and badness in most every expectation. Some are worse than others. Others better than some. But, there is an undeniable <span class="italics">something</span> worth finding in every moment. Whether it’s Willy’s or Katsumi’s hopes in moments of despair or Gatsby’s lost love after a moment of relative success or my discovery of <span class="italics">real</span> snow in the midst of hypothermic temperatures. Maybe it’s as simple as not seeking out the bad. Denying it and clinging to the smile before the balloon pops or the silence after the bang. </p>
<p>Is it denial of reality? Maybe. I don’t think so. We ought not let go of faith—of expectation—so easily, as unhealthy and blind and wrong as it can be, so there’s got to be some other kind of balance to strike. A different expectation of sorts. Of finding the good in the bad. Of knowing you could so easily be wrong but still clinging to the thought that two plus two is five because, heck, for a single moment in time, it’s just easier that way. Of never taking things too seriously and, in fact, of taking every fall just lightly enough that you eventually figure out how to fly.</p>
<p>Because, well, why not?</p>
<p>Why does everything have to be so hard on the edges and so <span class="italics">pointed</span> at the corners?</p>
